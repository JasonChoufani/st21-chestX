# st21-chestX
<b>ChestX</b> is a <b>TechLabs Berlin</b> project that aims to detect COVID-19 infection by processing chest X-ray images. To support medical decision making, the ChestX team wants to apply AI techniques for object detection & classification, as well as data science methods. Metadata provided alongside the X-ray images can be analysed to provide doctors with more meaningful diagnostic assistance.

## Data set
The COVID-19 image data collection is a public open dataset of chest X-ray and CT images of patients which are positive or suspected of COVID-19 or other viral and bacterial pneumonias. The project was started and is maintained by Joseph Paul Cohen, Paul Morrison, and Lan Dao from the University of Montreal.
Please, watch the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ineWmqfelEQ) for a quick project introduction, or check out their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11597) for more details about the [data set](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset). <br> To complement the data we found suitable after data-cleaning, x-ray images from [this covid19 radiography database](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) were also added to this project for AI training. 

The COVID-19 data sets is linked as submodule to this git project. <br>Run the following code to download the submodule:
```git submodule update --init --recursive```
<br>To update the submodul run:
```git submodule update --remote --merge```

Do download the second data set, please run this CML to connect to the kaggle API:<br>
```kaggle datasets download -d tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database```

## Running the project on localhost
After clonning the repository, and having the complete project files saved in a directory on you computer, open the project folder with your desired editor.

To run the frontend part of the project:
- Navigate to the directory of the frontend files: ```cd frontend-chest-X```
- Install node.js on your computer if you do not already have it installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- To check the version of node.js you have installed, type: ```node -v```
- Install angular globally: ```npm install -g @angular/cli```
- To install all the frontend dependencies: ```npm install```
- To open the frontend on localhost: ```ng serve --port 4200```
